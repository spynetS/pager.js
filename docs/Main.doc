Main idea lightweight framework which is easy to learn for normal developer. Similar to react
Main functions
Components
Components are made in classes where you have a render function where you will write your html. This will be compiled to a string with our compiler. This string will later be added to the main component that will append it to a div in the index.html file. 

When adding a component to the html you will add it as a normal html component


props
props are passed as attributes in html
<ExampleComponent name=”name” ></ExampleComponent>

if we want to pass a js variable we can do it the same way but with curly brackets
<ExampleComponent name={name} ></ExampleComponent>

This will create in the background
